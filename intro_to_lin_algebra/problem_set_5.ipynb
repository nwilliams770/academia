    "### Key Findings from the Left Null Space Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Understanding the Problem\n",
    "- We were given an inconsistent system $Ax = b$, meaning **no solution exists**.\n",
    "- This means that $b$ **is not in the column space** of $A$.\n",
    "- Instead of solving for $x$, we found a vector $y$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ y^T A = 0 \\quad \\text{(i.e., $y$ is in the left null space)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  but\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ y^T b = 1. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This revealed a **contradiction** because it implies $b$ is **also not in the row space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Role of the Left Null Space\n",
    "- The **left null space** of $A$ consists of all solutions to $A^T y = 0$, meaning it contains vectors that are **orthogonal to the row space**.\n",
    "- If $Ax = b$ had a solution, then every vector $y$ in the left null space would satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ y^T b = 0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- But since $y^T b = 1$, **this contradicts the fact that $b$ should be in the row space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "- The left null space acts as a **\"consistency check\"**:  \n",
    "  - If $y^T b \\neq 0$, then $b$ **must be outside the row space**, meaning $Ax = b$ is **inconsistent**.\n",
    "  - This is why the left null space is so powerful—it detects impossible systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Relationship to Matrix Rank\n",
    "- The inconsistency of $Ax = b$ tells us that **$A$ is not full rank**.\n",
    "- The dimensions of the four fundamental subspaces follow from the **Rank-Nullity Theorem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\dim(C(A)) + \\dim(N(A)) = n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\dim(C(A^T)) + \\dim(N(A^T)) = m $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - **$\\dim(C(A))$** = column space (number of independent columns = rank of $A$).\n",
    "  - **$\\dim(N(A))$** = null space (free variables in $Ax = 0$).\n",
    "  - **$\\dim(C(A^T))$** = row space (same as $\\dim(C(A))$).\n",
    "  - **$\\dim(N(A^T))$** = left null space (extra constraints on the system).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Final Summary of What We Learned\n",
    "- If $Ax = b$ has **no solution**, then $b$ is **not in the column space**.\n",
    "- The **left null space** helps prove inconsistency by detecting contradictions.\n",
    "- $y$ in the **left null space** satisfies $y^T A = 0$, meaning it’s **perpendicular to the row space**.\n",
    "- If $y^T b \\neq 0$, this tells us **$b$ is also not in the row space**, proving inconsistency.\n",
    "- This confirms that $A$ is **not full rank**, meaning it has a nontrivial **null space and left null space**.\n"

    "    - $y^T b = 1$ (confirming inconsistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Left Null Space Vector $y$\n",
    "- Instead of solving $A^T y = 0$ directly, we recognize that $y$ represents a **linear dependency among the rows of $A$**.\n",
    "- By **eyeballing how to combine rows to sum to zero**, we constructed:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  y = [1,1,-1].\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- This method is valid because the **left null space consists of exactly these linear dependencies**.\n",

    "  $$\n",

    "- Since $y^T b \\neq 0$, this confirms that $b$ is **not in the row space**.\n",
    "- By **Fredholm’s Alternative**, this means $Ax = b$ is **inconsistent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaway\n",
    "- **Finding a left null space vector by inspection is a valid approach**—it highlights dependencies without requiring row reduction.\n",
